## Method

### Local Motion Signal

It is also possible to compute the local motion signals using other techniques. For example, classical optical flow and point correlation methods were successfully used in previous work on visual vibration sensing.

### 1D Motion Signal

These local motion signals are aligned and averaged into a single, 1D motion signal that captures global movement of the object over time.
